  <p>
    <span class="font-semibold">cancelSubscription</span> lets your users cancel their subscription.
  </p>

  <pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
      userbase.cancelSubscription().then((result) => {
        // user sucessfully canceled subscription
      }).catch((e) => console.error(e))

  </pre>

  <h3 id="result">Result</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="field">result</span> [object] - Contains the date the subscription is set to be canceled.
      <ul>
        <li><span class="field">cancelSubscriptionAt</span> [string] - The date the user's subscription is set to be canceled.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="params">Notes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Your user will not be charged again for the subscription your app is currently set to after successfully calling this function.
    </li>
    <li>
      If your user is subscribed to a plan and you delete that subscription plan on your app in the Admin panel and then set a new plan, this function will not cancel that user's subscription plan. You must manually delete that user's plan in the Stripe dashboard.
    </li>
    <li>
      This sets your user’s subscription to cancel at the end of the current period. For example, if your user purchases a yearly subscription on May 4th, 2021 and then cancels the subscription on June 10th, 2021, then your user’s subscription will cancel on May 4th, 2022.
    </li>
    <li>
      After this function is called successfully, your user's <span class="field">cancelSubscriptionAt</span> will be set to to the date the subscription is set to be canceled. If the user's <span class="field">subscriptionStatus</span> was set to 'active' before calling this function, the user will still be able to call <a href="/docs/sdk/open-database/">openDatabase</a> on an app with payments enabled until the subscription is canceled on that date.
    </li>
  </ul>
