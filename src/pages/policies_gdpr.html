  <h2>Userbase GDPR compliance</h2>

  <p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018. Userbase is ready.</p>

  <h3>Does GDPR affect me?</h3>

  If you’re based in the EU or have users from the EU, then GDPR applies to you. By storing certain <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/">personally identifiable</a> data in Userbase, such as usernames and email addresses, you become a Controller of personal data under GDPR, so you need to enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with any online services and third party vendors you rely on, including Userbase. These agreements are commonly called a Data Processing Addendum, or DPA.

  <h3>Data Processing Addendum</h3>

  <p>You will soon be able to sign the Userbase DPA online. In the meantime, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@userbase.com">privacy@userbase.com</a> and we will provide you with our DPA.</p>

  <h3>Subprocessors</h3>
  Userbase uses third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and payment processors, to provide our services. We enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, and require the same of them. <a href="/policies/subprocessors">List of Userbase subprocessors</a>.
